"Version": "2012-10-17": This is the policy language version. It indicates the version of the policy language that you want to use.

"Statement": This is the main element of an IAM policy. It's an array of individual statements. Each statement is a distinct permission, which is a combination of actions, resources, and a condition (optional). In this policy, there are four statements, each defining access to a specific AWS service.

The first statement allows querying, getting, putting, updating, and deleting items in any DynamoDB table across all regions and accounts.

The second statement allows publishing to, subscribing to, and unsubscribing from any Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic, irrespective of region or account.

The third statement allows sending, receiving, and deleting messages in any Simple Queue Service (SQS) queue across all regions and accounts.

The final statement allows inserting records, reading records, getting shard iterators, and describing any Kinesis data stream across all regions and accounts.

"Effect": "Allow": This means the statement results in allowing the specified actions.

"Action": This includes a list of specific actions on the AWS service that the policy controls. They are service-specific actions (e.g., "dynamodb:Query" allows querying a DynamoDB table).

"Resource": This specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. The "*" (asterisk) is a wildcard meaning "all."
