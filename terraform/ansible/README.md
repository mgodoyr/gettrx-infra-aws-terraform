Update apt cache: The playbook begins by updating the APT (Advanced Package Tool) cache. APT is a package manager used by Debian and its derivatives like Ubuntu. The cache_valid_time parameter is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour) which means the local .deb files in the cache are considered up-to-date for an hour after they were last fetched.

Install Node.js and NPM: This task installs Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) using the APT package manager. It utilizes a loop (with_items) to install multiple packages.

Add Datadog APT GPG key: In this task, the GPG key for Datadog's APT repository is added. GPG keys are used to authenticate the packages in a repository.

Add Datadog APT repository: Here, the Datadog APT repository is added to the system's list of repositories from which packages can be fetched.

Update apt cache again: The APT cache is updated again after adding the new repository to ensure that the system is aware of the packages in the Datadog repository.

Install Datadog Agent: The Datadog agent is installed. The state is set to "latest" to ensure the most recent version of the agent is installed.

Install NGINX: The NGINX web server is installed.

Create web HTML files: This task uses Ansible's template module to create NGINX configuration files from specified source files (first_web_file.html and second_web_file.html). The files are placed in the "/etc/nginx/sites-available" directory.

Enable NGINX sites: The created configuration files are then symbolically linked to the "/etc/nginx/sites-enabled" directory to enable the sites. This is a common practice for managing multiple sites or applications with NGINX.

Restart NGINX: Finally, the NGINX service is restarted to apply the changes.
